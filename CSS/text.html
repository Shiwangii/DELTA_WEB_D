    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>
      At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter Christine Everhart
      informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the
      Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira.
      Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the
      villagers. While flying home, Stark is intercepted by F-22 Raptors. He
      reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end
      the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's
      prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the
      Ten Rings and has staged a coup to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO
      by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has him and the
      rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse-engineered
      from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark
      sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the
      Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had
      a direct route to Stark's weapons.

      Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so
      Stane ambushes Stark at his home and steals the one from his chest. Stark
      manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several
      S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and
      attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor
      to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the
      top of the Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs Potts to
      overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a
      massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the
      exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark
      publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man".
